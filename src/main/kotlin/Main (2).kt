//TODO This program has bugs and incomplete code in it...you will need to fix them so you have the following functionality:
// The main method should:
//    - print out the letterValues to the console
//    - ask the user to enter a word
//    - display the Scrabble Score for the word (the case of the letters shouldn't matter i.e. u is the same as U)
//    - the user should be continually asked to enter a word until they type a sentinel value (e.g. -1) to end the program

fun main() {
    println(scrabbleScore.letterValues())
    while (true) {
        println("Enter a word and compute the Scrabble Score: ")
        val word = input.nextLine()
        println("$word has a value of ${scrabbleScore.scoreWord(word)}")
